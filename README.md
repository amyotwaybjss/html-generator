Let's work with fruit trees for the example

A tree has a species name and a genus name, it also has a group it belongs to

A tree may be:
  old (inactive), growing (testing), dormant (semi-active), flowering (active, not in use) or fruiting (active, in use)
  
When fruiting, it has several qualities, such as location, fruit colour, fruit shape...

These qualities are optional and may depend on location.

Potentially each tree has a short description to say what it looks like

Potentially there are images of the tree which vary depending on status of tree (flower or fruit)

Orchard owner is a separate object with different attributes

Aim is to pull up different combinations of these traits in a text block, so that I don't have to write the details
