# let's work with fruit trees for the example
# a tree has a species name and a genus name, it also has a group it belongs to
# a tree may be dormant (inactive), flowering (semi-active) or fruiting (active in use)
# when fruiting, it has several qualities, such as location, fruit colour, fruit shape...
# these qualities are optional and may depend on location.
# potentially each tree has a short description to say what it looks like
# potentially there are images of the tree which vary depending on status of tree (flower or fruit)
# orchard owner is a separate object with different attributes
# aim is to pull up different combinations of these traits in a text block, so that I don't have to write the details
